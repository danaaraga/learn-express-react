## Project Overview

This learning path focuses on building a complete dashboard application with the following features:

- User authentication (registration, login, logout)
- Role-based access control
- Dashboard with data visualization
- CRUD operations for managing resources
- RESTful API design
- Responsive UI design

By the end of this course, you'll have a portfolio-worthy project that demonstrates your fullstack JavaScript skills.

## Learning Objectives

### Beginner Level
- Understand the fundamentals of Node.js and JavaScript ES6+
- Learn Express.js basics for building RESTful APIs
- Master React fundamentals and component-based architecture
- Implement user authentication and session management
- Work with databases (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)

### Intermediate Level
- Build scalable and maintainable code architecture
- Implement advanced React patterns (Hooks, Context API)
- Create secure REST APIs with proper validation
- Handle file uploads and data processing
- Implement real-time features with WebSockets

### Advanced Level
- Deploy applications to production environments
- Implement testing strategies (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Optimize application performance
- Implement security best practices
- Work with microservices architecture

## Prerequisites

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites Installation

1. Install Node.js (version 14 or higher) from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Install a code editor (VS Code recommended)
3. Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)

### Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/santrikoding/learn-express-react.git
   cd learn-express-react
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
